<h1><strong>Bootstrap Portfolio Page</strong></h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
The aim of this challenge was to build a portfolio page showcasing my work to potential future employers. 

The work was carried out to ensure I have the skills to display my work online in the hope to optimise my future job opportunities and potential collaborations.

This challenge helped me learn about and how to utilise Bootstrap aswell as honing my Flex Box, CSS Grid, media queries, HTML and CSS skills learnt in the previous modules. 

Here are some finer details of what I have learnt:-
<ul>
  <li>Adding a nav bar with links which are appropriate to my portfolio with ref links to help the user navigate the site.</li>
  <li>Adding custom classes to enable Bootstrap customisation via CSS.</li>
    <li>Adding and editing a hero section with a jumbotron.</li>
    <li>Displaying my work via a grid section containing cards.</li>
    <li>Adding and formatting a Skills and About Me section on the same row.</li>
    <li>Ensuring the footer hyperlinks have a hover effect.</li>
    <li>Ensuring the footer buttons display a box shadow upon hover.</li>
    <liv>Ensuring media queries are minimised via utilisation of Bootstrap</li>
    <li>Deploying applications</li>
  </ul>
  
Technologies used:- MAC Terminal, VS Code and Git Hub.
